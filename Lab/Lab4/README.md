# Underwater Plastic Pollution Detection - Lab Report

This repository contains the necessary files and code for detecting underwater plastic pollution using the YOLOv (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. The focus is on identifying plastic waste in underwater images and analyzing the modelâ€™s performance.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Underwater Plastic Pollution Detection Using YOLOv.pdf**  
   A comprehensive report detailing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. The report offers insights into the application of YOLOv for underwater plastic detection and its evaluation metrics.

2. **Underwater plastic pollution detection using yolov.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for:  
   - Data loading and preprocessing  
   - Training and evaluating the YOLOv model  
   - Visualizing detection results and performance metrics
